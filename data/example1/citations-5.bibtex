    abstract = "{The paucity of Hepatitis B (HBV) DNA measurement in low and middle-income countries hinders the identification of HBV-infected pregnant women at-risk of perinatal transmission. This study evaluates the validity of an algorithm selecting HBeAg-positive women and HBeAg-negative women with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥40 IU/L as predictor of high HBV DNA level.All women with reactive sample for HBsAg were assessed with SD BIOLINE HBeAg rapid test and HBV DNA quantification was performed. Validities of HBeAg and of the algorithm to identify HBV DNA higher than two thresholds (5.3 and 7.3 Log10 IU/mL) were evaluated.For the 515 positive HBsAg women, median age was 29 years, 92 (17.9\\%) were HBeAg positive, 47 (9.1\\%) were HBeAg negative with ALT ≥40 IU/L and 144 (28.0\\%) had an HBV DNA \\&gt;5.3 Log10 UI/mL. Sensitivity and specificity of HBeAg were 61.8\\% and 99.2\\% for HBV DNA \\&gt;5.3 Log10 UI/mL and 81.3\\% and 96.7\\% for HBV DNA \\&gt;7.3 Log10 UI/mL. For the algorithm, sensitivity and specificity were 79.2\\% and 93.3\\% for HBV DNA level \\&gt;5.3 Log10 UI/mL and 92.7\\% and 88.1\\% for HBV DNA \\&gt;7.3 Log10 UI/mL. The AUCs for the algorithm (0.92 and 0.94 for HBV DNA \\&gt;5.3 and 7.3 respectively) were significantly greater (p\\&lt;0.001) than the AUCs for HBeAg (0.81 and 0.89 for HBV DNA \\&gt;5.3 and 7.3 respectively).An algorithm using HBeAg and ALT level could be an effective strategy to identify HBV-infected pregnant women at risk of perinatal transmission in countries where HBV DNA quantification is not routinely available.}",
